There are a total of 8 tracks in the game namely: Carbon dioxide, Methane, Ozone, Temperature, Ice Volume, Ice Sheets, Ocean Warming, and Sea Level. Basically, these track names are the most important climate change factors. Each track has a specific number of learning lessons followed by a group of quiz games.
